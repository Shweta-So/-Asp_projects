ACTION SELECTOR:
- Startup Configuration:
The application begins by creating a WebApplication builder, which is used to configure services and the application's request pipeline.
It registers controller services with AddControllers() to support MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
-Middleware Configuration:
UseRouting() middleware is used to enable routing capabilities, which allows the app to match URLs to controllers and actions.
UseAuthorization() middleware sets up the authorization services, though no specific authorization policies are defined in this snippet.
-Routing:
Multiple routes are defined using MapControllerRoute, but they all mistakenly use the same name "default". This might cause conflicts or unexpected behavior, as each route should typically have a unique name.
The routes are intended to map URLs to specific actions in the HomeController. However, the route patterns incorrectly refer to non-existent actions (Index, Index1, Delete, and Update) due to the actual action methods having different names or attributes.
-HomeController:
Index: Mapped with [ActionName("i1")], it should respond to an endpoint that recognizes this attribute, but no such mapping is configured in the routing.
Index1: Similarly marked with [ActionName("i2")], it should also respond to a different endpoint configured to recognize this attribute, which is also missing in the routing setup.
Delete: This action is correctly annotated with [HttpGet], indicating it should respond to HTTP GET requests.
Update: This method is decorated with [NonAction], which means it is not accessible via HTTP and won't be treated as an action method by MVC.
-Issues & Recommendations:
Routing Conflicts: The route name "default" is reused, which can lead to issues in route resolution. Each route should ideally have a unique name.
Action Mappings: The actual action methods (i1 for Index and i2 for Index1) are not reflected in the route configurations. The routes should be updated to match the decorated action names.
In summary, the project aims to set up a basic MVC structure with custom routing to different actions in a controller.
